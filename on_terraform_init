Note, You need to run terraform init so that terraform can download the code required to interact with the particular providers you are using in your .tf files.

The terraform binary doesn't contain any information about the providers so this step is neccessary.

The provider code will be downloaded into a .terraform folder. Might want to add this to your .gitignore.

Safe to run init many times (idempotent). Always run it when getting started with new Terraform code.
